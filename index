<img src="StevenWhiteSyracusePhoto.png" height="300" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 0 25px">I am an assistant professor of political science in the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. My book, <i>World War II and American Racial Politics: Public Opinion, the Presidency, and Civil Rights Advocacy</i>, was published by Cambridge University Press. My research has also been published in the <i>American Political Science Review</i>, <i>American Politics Research</i>, <i>Politics, Groups, and Identities</i>, <i>Social Science Quarterly</i>, and <i>Studies in American Political Development</i>. I was the co-recipient of the 2022 Heinz I. Eulau Award for best article in the <i>APSR</i> from the American Political Science Association. I am currently working on several new projects, including a book manuscript tentatively titled <i>The Political Influence of the Police in American Cities</i>.

During the 2019-2020 academic year, I was on leave as a visiting research scholar at the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at Princeton University. Before arriving at Syracuse, I taught at Lafayette College and was a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University. I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University and my B.A. from Hampshire College. I'm originally from east Tennessee.
