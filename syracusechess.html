<title>OTB Chess in Syracuse</title>

Syracuse doesn't have an official chess club with rated games. However, there are a large number of regular OTB meet-ups scattered around the area. This list is my attempt at gathering them all together in one place. 
  
  <p>
  
    With the exception of the monthly High Noon tournament, most of these are located in various nearby suburbs. For those interested in USCF-rated classical games, I have provided a separate list of regional opportunities following the list of casual meet-up games.
