<title>OTB Chess in Syracuse</title>

<font size="+3"><b>Interested in playing chess in Syracuse?</b></font><br><br>

Syracuse doesn't have an official chess club with rated games. However, there are a large number of regular OTB meet-ups scattered around the region. This list is my attempt at gathering them all together in one place. With the exception of the monthly High Noon tournament, most of these are located in various nearby suburbs.
